LifeCoachService
================

LifeCoach Health and lifestyle monitoring web service application as part of Introduction to Service Design and Engineering course in University of Trento.

The goal of this project is to offer a solution that could help user monitor their life style and health measures. This application is thought for both users who are facing health issues and for those who want to improve their lifestyle and health. The application allows the user to manage their measurements, define goals and monitor them, manage schedules and log everyday meal consumption. The users get immediate feedback about their progress towards the goals, about their measurements and meal logging. . Another feature is the motivational quotes, which tries to give some kind of support to the users to fulfill their goals. Also the application reminds the users about their schedules. Currently the application is supporting reminders only through the User Interface.
